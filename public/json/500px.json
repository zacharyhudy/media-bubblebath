            "description": "It was a strange moment when i photographed this bridge at 8.02am-Sep 28/2014. Thick fog and less light. But my camera kept showing over-exposure even when I set it to f16, 1/4000 & ISO 200. I also put a variable ND filter but it didn't help either. The bridge's holders at the back also shouldn't shape like that. I remember that I had trouble with exposure & angle of view when I got closer to the bridge. Not to mention that there were some distraction of some objects around that bridge,\n\nSeem like the bridge and the fog were mad at me or something. The camera is X-Pro1 & the lens is Tokina RMC II 28mm f2.8 FD mount. Is there anybody who can explain this? Maybe from the lens point of view?",
